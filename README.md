# MyReads App

This is the first project for the Udacity React Nanodegree programm. This application allows you to search for books and place the selected books on to shelf. There are two pages: The Homepage shows the three bookshelfs, currently reading, want to read, and read.
The search page will allow the user to search for books.

## Getting Started
After downloading or cloning the repository run `<npm install>`. Once installed use `<npm start>` to launch the project.


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
